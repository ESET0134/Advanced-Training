# Meter Data Management System (MDMS)

## Overview

The **Meter Data Management System (MDMS)** is a full-featured, role-based **React.js** application designed for managing and monitoring electricity meter data.  
It supports three levels of access â€” **End User**, **Zone Level User**, and **Enterprise Level User** â€” each with tailored dashboards and functionalities.  

This project serves as a **learning platform** to explore **Advanced React concepts**, including custom hooks, API integration, reusable components, authentication, logging, localization, and Tailwind-based responsive UI.

---

## Purpose

The MDMS provides a **centralized system** for electricity data management and analytics.  
It also demonstrates modern **React architecture** and **real-world project standards** suitable for enterprise-level applications.

---

## User Roles & Core Features

### End Users
- View personal electricity consumption.
- Visual charts for daily/weekly/monthly usage.
- Access and download bills.
- View payment history and outstanding balance.
- Manage profile, photo, and password.
- Configure notification preferences.
- View historical meter readings
- Compare usage with previous periods
- Alerts for abnormal usage.
- Log all user interactions.

---

### Zone-Level Users
- Zone-wide dashboard with total consumption and active meters.
- Alerts for abnormal consumption patterns.
- Manage meters: Add, Edit, Deactivate, Import/Export.
- Manage end users and reset passwords.
- Generate zone-specific reports.
- Configure zone-level notifications.

---

### Enterprise-Level Users
- Global dashboard with multi-zone analytics and KPIs.
- High-level alerts for critical issues
- Manage zones and assign administrators.
- Manage all meters and users across zones.
- Configure enterprise-level policies, data retention, and auto-logout timer.
- Full **Audit Logs** system with PDF/CSV export.
- Localization, currency, and timezone customization.

## Logging & Audit Trail

- Each **login**, **logout**, **password reset**, and **page visit** is logged in `localStorage.userLogs`.
- **End Users** can view only their logs in their Logs tab.
- **Enterprise Users** can view and export all logs in Enterprise View via the Audit Logs page.

---

## Mock Data Initialization

MDMS uses a built-in mock data service via `authService.init()`.  
On first run, it auto-creates three user roles:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|--------|----------|
| End User | `enduser@mdms.com` | `mdms123` |
| Zone Admin | `zone@mdms.com` | `zone123` |
| Enterprise Admin | `enterprise@mdms.com` | `enterprise123` |

The mock data is stored in:

    localStorage['mdms_auth_user']

## Running the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

---

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ESET0134/Advanced-Training.git
                        OR
git clone git@github.com:ESET0134/Advanced-Training.git
cd .\Bucket4\React\Project\mdms1\
```
### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js v16+ installed, then run:
```bash
npm install
```
If you are setting up from scratch, install the dependencies manually:
```bash
npm install react react-dom react-router-dom
npm install recharts
npm install jspdf jspdf-autotable
npm install react-i18next i18next
npm install lucide-react
npm install axios
```
### Setup Tailwind CSS

If Tailwind is not already configured, run:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npm install -D tailwindcss@3.4.17
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then edit your tailwind.config.js file as follows:
```js
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
Add Tailwind directives to your src/index.css:
```bash
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
### Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit the app in your browser:
ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:5173

### Available Scripts

| Command| Description  |
|-----------|----------------------|
| npm run dev | Runs the development server |
| npm run build | Builds the app for production |
| npm run preview | Previews the production build locally |
| npm run lint | Runs ESLint for code checking |
