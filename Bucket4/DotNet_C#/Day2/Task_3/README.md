### Static Member and Method Practice
 
Create a class Company with fields: employeeName, employeeId, and a static field companyName.
 
Implement:
 
    1. Constructor to initialize employeeName and employeeId.
    2. Static method DisplayCompanyName().
    3. Create multiple objects and demonstrate that all employees share the same company name, while other fields are individual.
